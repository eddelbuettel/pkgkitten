### Details

The `playWithPerPackageHelpPage` function can be used to create a simple
help page for a package.

It has been split off from the `kitten` function so that it can be
called from other packages. As such, it is also exported from
<span class="pkg">pkgKitten</span>.

### Value

Nothing is returned as the function is invoked for its side effect of
creating a new package.
